# install-latest-tesseract-ocr
Bash script to install latest tesseract-ocr with all the dependencies and housekeeping.

I found that for compiling the latest version of tesseract, you have to do a ton of things because the project has been moved  
to github which was previously on code.google.com. Also, I found the wiki provided in the github is not that helpful.  
This script will completely install tesseract on Debian Linux.  

#### Note:
Change the version numbers and/or names inside the scipt for both tesseract and leptonica (and others it necessary)  
in case a new versions have arrived.
